Project Overview and Purpose

Jargon Linker is a single-page application (SPA) built to help users keep track of custom terms and their definitions. The purpose of the app is to provide a simple, personal and global glossary tool where users can quickly store, organize, and reference the jargon they come across.

Features and Functionality

Add, edit, and delete custom jargon terms with definitions

Entries saved permanently in browser using localStorage

Sorting options: alphabetical or most recent

Search bar with inline clear button and ESC-key support

Timestamps for each entry to track when terms were added or updated

Clean, user-friendly interface with simple styling

Known Issues or Limitations

Data is only stored locally in the browser and cannot be shared across devices

Search is case-sensitive, which may affect usability

No option yet to back up or export saved jargon

Future Enhancement Ideas

Add data export/import to share or back up terms

Implement case-insensitive search for smoother results

Add categories or tags to better organize jargon

Create a cloud-sync option so terms are available across devices

Improve UI with themes or dark mode
